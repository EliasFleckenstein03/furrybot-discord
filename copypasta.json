	"kys": "I have often times contemplated suicide. I suffer from depression and find a lot of things hard to deal with. Obviously I've never gone through with it, I'm not some kind of computer ghost. I think it stems a lot from my years in middle school. It was right after my parents had gotten divorced, my dog had died, and I gained enough weight from emotional eating to be considered \"clinically obese,\" something that the doctor decided to withhold from me for a few years, for some reason. I got bullied a lot in this time and felt a real sense of distance between myself, my friends, and my family. Kind of like I was alone in the world. I'm doing a lot better now. I lost pretty much all of the weight, learned better social skills, and have gone on to be a mostly happy person. In a lot of ways, that struggle really did help me become a better person. It helped me really develop a sense of humor, since I had to learn to laugh at a lot of shit. It helped me grow a thicker skin, since I had to learn to deal with other peoples' bullshit. And, overall, I think it just made... Better. It made me want to keep on living. Now, after seeing this picture, I truly know how it feels to want to stop being alive. Thank you for that.",
	"retard": "The R-word, “retard,” is slang for the term mental retardation. Mental retardation was what doctors, psychologists, and other professionals used to describe people with significant intellectual impairment. Today the r-word has become a common word used by society as an insult for someone or something stupid. For example, you might hear someone say, “That is so retarded” or “Don’t be such a retard.” When used in this way, the r-word can apply to anyone or anything, and is not specific to someone with a disability. But, even when the r-word is not said to harm someone with a disability, it is hurtful.\nBecause of this, the greater disability community prefers to focus on people and their gifts and accomplishments, and to dispel negative attitudes and stereotypes.  The purpose of the Spread the Word to End the Word® campaign is to raise peoples’ awareness of the derogatory use of the R-Word (retard or retarded) and its negative effects on people with intellectual disabilities, as well as their families and friends. However, this campaign is about more than just raising awareness of the R-word; it is also about changing attitudes of segregation and hate, to attitudes of acceptance and respect.",

	"smartest": "I am very smart. My mother tested me at a young age and said that my IQ was around 140, That's more than most of the human race has. So before you have a conversation with me, understand that my intelligence is so unbelievably great that most of you imbeciles would not be able to comprehend. It's quite sad really. I sometimes use old Latin words in my sentences so well that people don't even know what I said. Truly amazing. Do not even respond to this post unless you have an IQ over 120, because you would just be an utter waste of my valuable time that I could use contemplating life.",
	"faggot": "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little shit? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Pu$$y Destr0yers, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on your mom's pu$$y, and I have over 300 confirmed pu$$y penetrations. I am trained in handling the pu$$y and I’m the top pu$$y destr0yer in the entire world. You are nothing to me but a joke. I will wipe your mom's pu$$y the fuck out with penetration the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Your mom is fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can destr0y your mom's pu$$y in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare fingers. Not only am I extensively trained in pu$$y destr0ying, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Pu$$y Destr0yers Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your mom's pu$$y off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and your mom's pu$$y. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.",
	"cuck": "The fact that no one has refuted your obviously flawed statement and assertion is beyond me. Why you're on this channel in the first place is beyond me but I find it actually a little funny you subjectively get to define for the person for them in what way they're defining cuck(old) you do not have a monoply on the definition for words.\nThe fact is I could go to google right now and look up the definition for cuck and if I were to look at the verb I'd see this. \"(of a man) make (another man) a cuckold by having a sexual relationship with his wife\" Just because something is exclusive to gender does not make it sexist you moron.\nThe definition used when it happens opposite to that is \"Cuckquean\" does that make it sexist because it objectifies men as property of the women..? No you fucking moron and you don't even understand how the fetish works these days.\nA man who is cuckolded is in the submissive position, they do not have the power in that sexual relationship it is afforded to the women to be the one dominating, the woman chooses a bull to have sex with her infront of her cuckold to humiliate and demean him.\nI could argue you about the objectivity of words all day, but there really isn't going to get us anywhere. I mean you already made yourself look like a fool by assuming what people meant when they said cuck even though I feel you should know better than that, you just wanted to virtue signal and have something to prove that everyone that says cuck must be a sexist.\n(i got this as a youtube comment reply, so no real source)",
	"questionmarks": "o, i love question marks, i have always loved question marks. no one respects question marks more than me. always have loved 'em, my homies. question marks and their beautiful bodies and the little dots under, fucking perfect. designed very carefully. that little curve, it's so beautiful. i could spend hours looking at that curve of it. they are my favorite, especially just one mark without the others so we can stare at each other without others being there. sentences don't matter when my baby mark is there, she'll always change everything.",
